Please create the objects in all three ways that you learnt in the class (unless explicitly mentioned).
Create a new object with direct instance (using new operator), and add some properties to that object. Accessing all properties of that object.
Create a new object with a user-defined function, and add some properties  to that object access all properties of the object.
Create a new object, and some properties, also add a function along with the object.
Create a new object,like “empdetails” that will contain methods that compute employee annual salary,and average salary of employee using two methods. (So create two methods like anunalsalary(),avgsalary()).
